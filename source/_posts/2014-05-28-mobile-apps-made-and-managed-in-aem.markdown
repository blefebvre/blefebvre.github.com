I'm thrilled to be returning to Basel this summer to present at the conference formerly known as CQCON: CONNECT Web Experience. This year I'll be speaking about building and managing mobile applications within AEM, with a focus on the technical details of the integration.

To frame the context of this integration, I told a story of a hypothetical company looking to extend the reach of their content by [building a mobile app](/blog/2014/03/14/so-you-want-to-build-an-app/). Since presenting at both Adobe SUMMIT and AEMHub, I've had a chance to work with some real, non-hypothetical customers, and have selected a few themes from these experiences to highlight specifically for an audience of highly-technical AEM pros.


- How did we get here?
- Integrating 3rd party code
- Dealing with the device level APIs
- Templates sharing on Angular's terms
