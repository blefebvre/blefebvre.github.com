The folks at [IoT Ottawa](http://www.meetup.com/iotottawa/events/184276702/) hosted an all-day meetup on the subject of the Internet of Things, right here in the Adobe Ottawa office tower. As someone new to the IoT field I found the many short, to-the-point sessions served as both a nice introduction to possibilities in the industry and also as a glimpse into the innovation happening right here in our backyard. What follows are my personal highlights from the day.

### Next-Generation Wearable Tech: Fitness Intelligence

As a cyclist and runner currently tracking my training using a number of devices and services, this talk really resonated with me. To sum it up:

- Wearables are becoming more intelligent
- In the most basic case: simply an accelerometer
- Better: heart rate, hydration monitor, lactic acid monitor, motion interpretation
- All about measuring & interpreting signals
- Future: "can we predict injuries?"
	- analyze population stats to find correlations 
	- warn user that what they're doing is incorrect; may lead to injury
- Future: train smarter
	- device will tell you when you're working too hard
	- or working inefficiently 
- Product under development: [LEO by GestureLogic](http://leohelps.com/)
	- crowd funding campaign coming soon


### Why Open Source will Drive IoT Innovation

- Message: open wins 
	- Like www, Apache, w3c, Linux
	- To be disruptive, IoT must follow
	- "Open wins devs"
- "Developers will choose with their feet"
	- Read: [The New Kingmakers](http://thenewkingmakers.com/)
- Less friction is the best model: no registration, and no fees
- IoT issues: it's complicated
	- open hardware is huge for IoT (like Arduino, Pi, etc.)
	- many protocols emerging: 
		- [paho](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/)
		- [OMA Lightweight M2M](http://iot.eclipse.org/protocols.html#oma-lwm2m)
		- [Moquette MQTT](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/moquette-mqtt)
		- [oneM2M](http://www.onem2m.org/)
	- many frameworks, too: 
		[Kura](http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/technology.kura/) - Java & OSGi based framework
		[Ponte](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.ponte) - bridge M2M to REST
	- "paradox of choice?"
		- No. We don't know which frameworks/protocols will win
