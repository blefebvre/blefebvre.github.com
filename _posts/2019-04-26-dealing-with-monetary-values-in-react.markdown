I gave a talk at the April 2019 installment of the [Ottawa React](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-ReactJS-Meetup/) meetup on the topic of "Dealing with Monetary Values in React". I had so much fun putting together this talk: from spending hours digging through my folks' photo archive for a picture of me working at Tim Hortons, to putting together a working replica of the cash register I remember from 16 years ago. The slides don't really stand on their own so I thought I would put together a short post with a few links to key resources.

## Floating point numbers in JavaScript

While it was a React meetup and the cash register example was built in React, these principles and libraries can work in JavaScript apps of any kind: Node, web, and React Native are all supported. 

The library that I highlighted for dealing with arbitrary precision floating point numbers is one call big.js written by GitHub user [Michael M](https://github.com/MikeMcl).

This was the
  - involving a couple of hours digging through my folks' photo archives for a picture of me working at Tims - and I wanted to share a few of the key points and links from the talk in post form.
