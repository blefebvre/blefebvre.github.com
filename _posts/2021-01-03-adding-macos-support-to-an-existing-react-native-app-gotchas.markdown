I first learned about the [React Native for macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos) project while investigating a claim I'd heard that _any iOS app_ could now run natively on Big Sur. Turns out I had heard wrong; iOS apps [can run natively on Big Sur](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_0_1-ios-ipados-apps-on-mac-release-notes), but only on Macs with the new Apple silicon (M1 chip).

Fortunately, the folks at Microsoft had been hard at work on [React Native for Windows + macOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started) which claims to enable you to run your React Native apps on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and greater. I have an app with a user base that would value being able to work on both mobile and desktop, so I decided to try it out.

This post details some of the gotchas I ran into while adding macOS support to an existing React Native app.

# Before you begin

I'd highly recommend giving the [Get Started with macOS - 0.62](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/0.62/rnm-getting-started) doc a read from top to bottom before attempting to add support to an existing app. It is short and sweet, and in a perfect world will give you a working macOS app in about 5 minutes. Worst case, you'll find out which dev dependencies you are missing and can get those sorted before beginning the process with your own app.

Next, ensure your existing app has been upgraded to React Native `0.62.2` (the latest 0.62 release). At the time of writing the latest release of RN is 0.63, but the "Get Started with macOS" states the following: "** Latest stable version available for React Native for macOS is 0.62**"

Are you a few versions behind? The [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) is an excellent tool for working through an upgrade. I've done a few of these now, and have my process documented here: [Upgrading a React Native app](/blog/2019/03/03/upgrading-react-native-with-rn-diff-purge/)

# Install

The installation itself is a breeze and was finished in a few minutes over a decent internet connection. I won't duplicate the steps here since they are very nicely laid out in the [Get Started with macOS - 0.62](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/0.62/rnm-getting-started) guide. 

Hopefully this part goes smoothly for you as well, but if not I'd recommend perusing the [react-native-macos GitHub repo issues tab](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) to see if there's a workaround for your problem.

Upon reaching the bottom of the "Get Started with macOS" guide you should have a shiny new `macos/` directly next to `ios/` and/or `android/` in your project root. Open your new `macos/*.xcworkspace` file with Xcode, select the `*-macOS` build target, and hit the play button to build and run your app.

Want to try out the React Native SQLite demo list app on macOS? You can find the source here: [github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo)

# Gotchas

Did your app open up, work perfectly, and not display any redbox errors? If so, I offer my sincere congratulations. You may close this browser tab now and begin the App Store release process for your new macOS app (after a thorough round of testing, of course ðŸ™‚).

If not, however, perhaps I can help by sharing the solutions/workarounds to issues that I ran into while adding macOS support to the [react-native-sqlite-demo](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo) app.

## Invariant Violation: `Native module cannot be null`

This was a frustrating one to debug. Which module are we talking about, here?

```
Invariant Violation: Native module cannot be null.

invariant
    index.bundle?platform=macos&dev=true&minify=false:1817:25
NativeEventEmitter
    index.bundle?platform=macos&dev=true&minify=false:34486:19

    FS.common.bundle?platform=macos&dev=true&minify=false&modulesOnly=true&runModule=false&shallow=true:14:54

```

### If you come across this error

My understanding of this error is that there is some JS code which is attempting to use a native module which does not exist in the compiled app, for whatever reason. Knowing this, the first step in resolving this error is understanding which native module is failing to run on macOS.

There is a clue in the fine print of the above stacktrace which I would not find until after some debugging and extensive Googling: starting at the top, look for the first line of fine print which involves a JS file from your app. In my apps case, [DropboxDatabaseSync](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo/blob/main/src/sync/dropbox/DropboxDatabaseSync.ts) is this file.

Next, open the file in question. If you aren't using source control now might be a good time to start, since I am going to suggest deleting source which you will _most likely_ want to add back later on. At the very least, take a complete backup of your app before making any changes.

Now it's time to remove imports for any native modules that this file includes, and comment out (or delete) the code which is making use of the imported module. In my case this first involved commenting out the following 4 lines, and then updating the code in the source file to not use these imports. This _complete breaks this feature_, of course, and is temporary - We are just performing a search for the module that is causing the error:

```
//import NetInfo from "@react-native-community/netinfo";
//import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
//import RNFetchBlob from "rn-fetch-blob";
//import RNFS from "react-native-fs";
```

With these imports commented out and the methods of this file updated to either return `Promise<void>` or `null`, I was able to run the app! 

> Note: In some cases I needed to re-run the app from Xcode in order to have my changes reflected in the macOS simulator. If you are stuck in a "RedBox loop", try re-running instead of reloading.

I began adding back in imports for these modules until I determined that the culprit of _my_ error was: `react-native-fs`. A quick search of the project's GitHub issues reveals that there are others who are [lobbying for macOS support](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/issues/887) already - ðŸ¤ž.

### Solution/workaround

So you've discovered that a dependency containing platform native code is not supported on macOS. What next?

In the [react-native-sqlite-demo](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo) app's case, this is not a critical dependency to run the app. It does break one of the app's main features (Dropbox database sync) unfortunately, but the app _can_ still function as a standalone app without it. 

An option available to support native functionality on platforms which support it, while disabling it on those which don't, is to leverage React Native's [Platform Specific Code](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code) features. I specifically like the [Platform-specific file extensions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions), which allow you "sub in" platform specific files as needed, without changing any of the code which uses those files.

In my case, the solution involved creating a [DropboxDatabaseSync.macos.ts](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo/blob/macOS-support/src/sync/dropbox/DropboxDatabaseSync.macos.ts#L15) platform-specific file which contains a mocked implementation of the `DatabaseSync` interface that basically does nothing. Since it does nothing, does not need the `react-native-fs` plugin, and the app is able to run successfully with this file picked when the app is run on macOS.

To avoid user frustration, I also added a [platform specific Settings page](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo/blob/macOS-support/src/components/SettingsScreen.macos.tsx#L19) which shows the following message when the app is run on macOS:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/react-native/macos/macOS-no-sync.png" alt="Screenshot of the app notifying the user that Dropbox sync is not available on macOS" width="350">

Another option, for my particular issue: since Dropbox is typically running locally on a user's machine, a potential workaround could be to bypass the need for the plugin (and sync mechanism) altogether by accessing the database file directly from it's location in the user's Dropbox folder. Something to try in a future post... ðŸ˜„


## `Modal` support

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/react-native/macos/invariant-violation.png" alt="Redbox error stating 'Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: RCTModalHostView was not found in the UIManager' (detailed in text form below)" width="350" >

```
Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RCTModalHostView" was not found in the UIManager.

This error is located at:
    in RCTModalHostView (at Modal.js:262)
    in Modal (at HomeScreen.tsx:36)
    in HomeScreen (at SceneView.tsx:122)
    in StaticContainer
    in StaticContainer (at SceneView.tsx:115)
    in EnsureSingleNavigator (at SceneView.tsx:114)
    in SceneView (at useDescriptors.tsx:153)
```

This error is due to the core React Native `Modal` component [not being supported on macOS and Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues/481). I was frustrated by this one at first since my two main RN apps both make extensive use of the Modal component. However, when you think about it, the UI pattern offered by Modal is not a very common pattern on non-mobile devices.

### Solution/workaround

Since Modal support is not implemented in the [react-native-macos](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos) project, I could have either implemented it myself (a larger task than I was hoping to take on), or switch from using Modal to something else. I chose the latter.

Up until this point I had tried to keep the dependencies of the [react-native-sqlite-demo](https://github.com/blefebvre/react-native-sqlite-demo) to a bare minimum to focus on the SQLite & Dropbox aspects. As a result I had deliberately avoided including a navigator. With Modal no longer being viable I figured that it was time to introduce a navigator, and landed on [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) which appeared to support macOS out of the box.

Note: if you choose this route, or perhaps you already use React Navigation in your app, note the following line in the Getting Started guide:

> Note: If you are building for Android or iOS, do not skip this step, or your app may crash in production even if it works fine in development. This is not applicable to other platforms.

```
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

// TODO!!


## Dropbox OAuth2 support (?)

# Unknowns

- Is the macOS project's iOS XCode target the one which should be used (instead of the previous ios project)?
