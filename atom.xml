    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Goal</h3>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/ssl-pub/ssl-geo.png" title="'Publish instance with an untrusted cert in action'" ></p>

<p>Set up an AEM publish instance with SSL to enable local, OS X-based development on <code>:8443</code>. These instructions are deliberately concise and not designed to be used in prod (refer to the <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/config-ssl.html">official docs</a> for that).</p>

<h3>You will need</h3>

<ul>
<li>An AEM publish instance (accessible - for the moment - on <code>:4503</code>)</li>
<li>A machine running OS X (the following was tested on Yosemite)</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h3>Generate keys</h3>

<p>Navigate to your publish instance&#8217;s <code>crx-quickstart</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd crx-quickstart/
</code></pre>

<p>Create an <code>ssl/</code> directory, and use <code>keytool</code> to generate your keystore file (replacing &#8216;password&#8217; below, if desired):</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir ssl
$ cd ssl/
$ keytool -genkeypair -keyalg RSA -validity 3650 -alias cqse -keystore cqkeystore.keystore -keypass password -storepass password
&lt;enter cert details as prompted&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A file named &#8216;cqkeystore.keystore&#8217; will be created in your current working directory.</p>

<h3>AEM configuration</h3>

<p>Navigate to CRX/de on your publish instance (<a href="http://localhost:4503/crx/de/index.jsp">http://localhost:4503/crx/de/index.jsp</a>) and log in with an administrator account.</p>

<p>Using the content browser, navigate to <code>/apps/</code>. Right click and create a folder called &#8216;system&#8217;, and inside this new folder create another called &#8216;config&#8217;.</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/ssl-pub/create-folder.png" title="'Create folders using CRXde'" ></p>

<p>Tap &#8216;Save All&#8217; to persist your new folders.</p>

<p>Create a new file in <code>/apps/system/config/</code> named &#8216;org.apache.felix.http.config&#8217;. For the contents of the file, paste in the following:</p>

<pre><code>org.apache.felix.https.enable=B"true"
org.apache.felix.https.keystore="crx-quickstart/ssl/cqkeystore.keystore"
org.apache.felix.https.keystore.key.password="password"
org.apache.felix.https.truststore="crx-quickstart/ssl/cqkeystore.keystore"
org.apache.felix.https.truststore.password="password"
org.apache.felix.http.nio=B"true"
org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=I"8443"
</code></pre>

<p>If you replaced &#8216;password&#8217; for the <code>keytool</code> command, make sure you use the same value in the above. Tap &#8216;Save All&#8217; to persist your new config file.</p>

<h3>Try it out</h3>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/ssl-pub/ssl-unsafe.png" title="'Unsafe!'" ></p>

<p>With any luck, your https-capable publisher should now be available at <a href="https://localhost:8443/">https://localhost:8443/</a>. You may see a page warning you against servers that use untrusted certificates, but for development purposes you can hit (on Chrome) &#8216;Advanced&#8217;, and &#8216;Proceed to localhost (unsafe)&#8217;.</p>

    <link href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2015/06/18/aem-6-dot-1-apps-starter-kit-improvements/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-18T11:29:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2015/06/18/aem-6-dot-1-apps-starter-kit-improvements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/release-notes.html">AEM 6.1 out the door</a>, we&#8217;ve pushed some commits to the <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit">Starter Kit repository</a> to ensure that the apps you bootstrap with it are taking advantage of the present state of the art. What follows is a visual tour of a few of those improvements.</p>

<h3>Native Page Transitions</h3>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/starter-kit-improvements/transitions.gif" title="'App showcasing native transitions'" ></p>

<p>Transitions between pages play such a big role in how your app&#8217;s performance is perceived, yet perfecting this animation with CSS can stump even the sharpest front-end dev. The Starter Kit now comes with the excellent <a href="https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/NativePageTransitions">Native Page Transitions</a> plugin enabled by default, delivering buttery smooth transitions while offloading the tedious <code>translate3d</code> (or was it <code>transform</code>?) work to native hardware acceleration. Many thanks go to <a href="https://twitter.com/eddyverbruggen">@eddyverbruggen</a> for all the hard work that went into this plugin!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>PhoneGap/Cordova CLI 5</h3>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/starter-kit-improvements/phonegap_cli_5.gif" title="'PhoneGap CLI v5 in action'" ></p>

<p>The latest PhoneGap command line interface (CLI) release contains a <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/04/28/phonegap-cli-5.0.0-0.27.0/">bunch of improvements</a>, but is (unfortunately) not compatible with the Geometrixx sample that shipped with 6.1. Not to fear: we will be releasing a rev of the sample shortly. In the meantime our Starter Kit is all set to take advantage of the new CLI, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cordova Android v4, which introduces support for <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a>!</li>
<li>The use of config.xml to manage platforms and plugins - a tidy alternative to writing custom hooks</li>
<li>Latest versions of all core plugins, including PhoneGap&#8217;s brand new <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-contentsync">Content Sync plugin</a></li>
<li>Analytics instrumentation with Adobe&#8217;s Mobile Services plugin</li>
</ul>


<h3>Separation of code from authorable content</h3>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/starter-kit-improvements/separation.png" title="'content-dev and content-author have split'" ></p>

<p>The code you write and the content your authors manage has been separated into two content packages to facilitate management as your AEM Apps project grows. With this model, you can continue to iterate on the code while authors work on the content without stepping on one another&#8217;s changes.</p>

<h3>&#8230; And more!</h3>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/starter-kit-improvements/responsive_sim.gif" title="'Responsive simulator in action'" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Responsive Simulator in the touch optimized editor is enabled by default</li>
<li>Starter Kit no longer includes a dependency on Geometrixx app code</li>
<li>Cordova splash page now sticks around until app initialization is complete</li>
</ul>


<p>We hope you find the new and improved <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit">Starter Kit</a> helpful for bootstrapping your next AEM Apps project! Please feel free to reach out in the comments below if you have any issues making it work for you, or have any other questions on AEM Apps.</p>

    <link href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2015/02/05/summit-2015-mobile-app-dev-and-content-management-with-aem/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-05T17:45:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2015/02/05/summit-2015-mobile-app-dev-and-content-management-with-aem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m thrilled to be returning to beautiful Salt Lake City this March to host a technical session on <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2015/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2586">Mobile App Development and Content Management with AEM</a> at Adobe SUMMIT 2015.</p>

<p>Digging through my chicken scratch in an old notebook, I was able to locate what I suspect to be my notes from one of the first meetings about the potential of an integration between Adobe PhoneGap (then, version 1.9) and AEM - better known as CQ 5.5 at the time (circa July 2012):</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/phonegap_cq_notes.jpeg" title="'First thoughts on Adobe PhoneGap and AEM'" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Reflecting from nearly three years later reveals that while much has changed, many of our initial thoughts on the subject still hold true today. As the number of platforms in the mobile space keeps growing it&#8217;s never been more important to be able to &#8220;write apps that behave as native apps without having to learn a new language&#8221;. With all the improvements that have been made to the web since we began, there is still a &#8220;gap&#8221; in the device features available to sites we visit with our mobile browsers and the APIs available to apps installed on our home screens. Still, the proposition of building apps with web technology we know and love is as appealing as I thought it was in 2012.</p>

<p>The integration of AEM and Adobe PhoneGap has come a long way in this time. Building on the feedback I received from my session at last year&#8217;s SUMMIT, my talk - <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2015/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2586">Mobile app dev and content management with AEM</a> - will take a technical deep dive into PhoneGap Enterprise. We&#8217;ll be covering as much as I can possibly fit into an hour: from creating your very first PhoneGap Enterprise app, to managing that app with the new and improved AEM Apps dashboard, to testing (from unit to integration to acceptance), and closing with a look at publishing content updates to your app - ensuring your customers will keep coming back for more. We&#8217;ll accomplish all this without losing track of our goals: utilizing tools that your team already knows, simplifying your overall app management pain points, and putting your brand in pole position with a flexible platform to deliver the next generation of mobile experiences.</p>

<p>After all this time, I still find it exciting.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wondering how you can deliver the next generation of mobile experiences? Attend Summit and join me at <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2015/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2586">Mobile app development and content management with AEM</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/11/17/aem-apps-featurepack-updates/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-17T11:16:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/11/17/aem-apps-featurepack-updates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A keen observer of AEM&#8217;s Package Share may have noticed two new offerings show up in the past couple of weeks. In particular, our team is thrilled to announce the availability of the <a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq600/featurepack/cq-6.0.0-featurepack-4558">AEM Apps feature pack 1</a>, and an updated <a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq60/product/cq-geometrixx-outdoors-app-pkg">Geometrixx Outdoors App sample</a> which demonstrates the usage of these new features. Let&#8217;s take a quick tour.</p>

<h3>Application Command Center</h3>

<p>The feature pack includes a single user interface for managing all aspects of an app’s lifecycle. The Command Center enables you to keep app content fresh and relevant, while understanding how the app is performing in one intuitive view.</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/sample-updates/apps-command-center.png" title="'AEM Apps Command Center'" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Towards the top left of this screenshot is the Details pane which enables configuration of app metadata including name and description, screenshots for app store submission, and update server URL amongst others. Heading clockwise is the Metrics pane which provides a high-level overview of key analytics data and gives access to Adobe Mobile Services for those wishing to delve further into the details. Last but not least is the PhoneGap Build tile which seamlessly integrates with Adobe&#8217;s cloud build service, enabling users to compile apps across three platforms without installing an SDK or configuring a single environment variable (you&#8217;re welcome, Windows users).</p>

<h3>App Update Management</h3>

<p>Application content can be updated instantly without requiring a trip back to the platform&#8217;s app store. Updates are managed through a straightforward workflow and tools are provided to verify content changes in development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/sample-updates/content-sync-update.jpg" title="'Content Sync Update Management'" ></p>

<p>In this screenshot I&#8217;m naming my latest update - a straightforward change of business hours - to keep a log of each update that I push out to my customers.</p>

<h3>App Content Authoring</h3>

<p>Content authors (non-technical users) can easily create and update app content using a touch based, WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop interface. The feature pack includes new mobile-optimized components for easy content creation.</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/sample-updates/apps-authoring.png" title="'Touch friendly authoring in action'" ></p>

<p>Pictured here is an app I created for my talk at <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2014/">PhoneGap Day</a> which I updated over-the-air on stage to demonstrate some of the capabilities of AEM Apps. The source for my demo can be <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-pgday-talk-app">found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Digital Publishing Suite Adobe Content Viewer Access</h3>

<p>The latest release of the Adobe Content Viewer can connect directly to an AEM authoring environment. Now AEM generated DPS content can be tested and validated without having to upload to the DPS Folio Publisher Service, enabling you to iterate more quickly on your content.</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/sample-updates/dps-acv.png" width="320" title="'Adobe Content Viewer'" ></p>

<h3>But wait, there&#8217;s more!</h3>

<p>To complement the feature pack release, we&#8217;ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-phonegap-starter-kit">AEM Apps Starter Kit</a> to take advantage of the state of the art in enterprise application development with AEM. Take a look at the README to see just how easy it is to bootstrap your own AEM Apps project today.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also brought my <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink">AEM Apps Kitchen Sink</a> project up to spec. If you haven&#8217;t tried it yet, the Kitchen Sink is an AEM App which demonstrates the usage of various Cordova/PhoneGap API&#8217;s, implemented as authorable components in an application that can be updated over-the-air.</p>

<p><img src="http://brucelefebvre.com/images/sample-updates/kitchen-sink-update.png" width="320" title="'Kitchen Sink OTA update'" ></p>

<p>On the technical side, the Kitchen Sink&#8217;s AEM page component has been completely re-written using <a href="http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/sightly.html">Sightly</a>, and we don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll miss JSP <em>at all</em>. Performance junkies will be pleased to learn that every page transition in the Kitchen Sink is handled by the awesome <a href="http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/native-page-transitions">NativePageTransitions</a> plugin.</p>

<p>As always, feedback or questions on the above are welcome. Please feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/brucelefebvre">twitter</a> or via the comments on this post.</p>

<p>As I compose this post at a kitchen table 850 km from home I can&#8217;t help but think about how much these shiny pocket computers have changed the way we work, play, and live. According to Apple&#8217;s numbers there have been over 75 billion individual app downloads since the introduction of the platform. At roughly this point last year Android was poised to overtake that number, reporting a staggering 2.5 billion downloads per month. As web technologists, how can we leverage our skill set to get in on the action?</p>

<p>In my talk at adaptTo() I&#8217;ll delve into Apache Cordova, a project built to enable cross-platform app development with standards-based web technology. I&#8217;ll explore how it can be used to interface directly with Apache Sling, and close with a demo of how the AEM + Cordova integration (affectionately known as PhoneGap Enterprise) can be used to empower your marketing personnel to keep your application&#8217;s content relevant with tools they already love. Code samples will be included to get you started today - with or without an AEM license.</p>

<p>If you have any questions that you&#8217;d like to see addressed during the talk, please feel free to reach out in the comments section below. Hope to see you there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iotottawa/events/184276702/">IoT Ottawa</a> hosted an all-day meetup on the subject of the Internet of Things, right here in the Adobe Ottawa office tower. As someone new to the IoT field I found the many short, to-the-point sessions served as both a nice introduction to possibilities in the industry and also as a glimpse into the innovation happening right here in our backyard. What follows are my personal highlights from the day.</p>

<h3>Next-Generation Wearable Tech: Fitness Intelligence</h3>

<p>As a cyclist and runner currently tracking my training using a number of devices (Garmin Edge, Forerunner, Strava iPhone app, Wahoo Kickr) and services (Strava, TrainerRoad, Fitbit), this talk really struck a chord with me.</p>

<p>In the most basic case, fitness wearables are simply accelerometers that interpret movement to calculate metrics including how many steps you&#8217;ve taken and floors you&#8217;ve climbed. When combined with some details of your physiology, they can estimate a number of additional metrics including number of calories burned and total distance traveled. The next generation of wearables will be smarter, both in terms of the sensors they use and the way they analyze and interpret the signals captured.</p>

<p>Advanced wearables will be able to sense and measure much more than basic motion. Hydration monitors, lactic acid monitors, and advanced motion interpretation are all features that we can expect to see in the next generation of fitness wearables. Sensors like these will be able to tell you if you&#8217;re in the right zone for the length of training ride you&#8217;re on, or if you&#8217;re going to burn out too early. They&#8217;ll be able to compare the motion and signals from your muscles to the profile of a professional athlete to provide tips on being more efficient. Using population statistics, they&#8217;ll warn you if a motion you&#8217;re performing has been known to lead to injury.</p>

<p>Leonard MacEachern spoke on behalf of his company GestureLogic who will soon be starting a crowd funding campaign for their product, <a href="http://leohelps.com/">LEO</a>, which aims to fill this market niche.</p>

<h3>Why Open Source will Drive IoT Innovation</h3>

<p>When I&#8217;m not riding my bike or running I can usually be found in front of a monitor working primarily with web technology. As a web developer, I have benefited in a big way from the open nature of the www, and strongly believe that much of the success of the platform has been a result of this openness.</p>

<p>Speaking as the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/">Eclipse Foundation</a>, Mike Milinkovich&#8217;s message was that in order for the IoT industry to be truly disruptive, it must follow the open pattern of the web. He reminded us that no matter how much money is thrown at a technology it&#8217;s still the developers who will <a href="http://thenewkingmakers.com/">choose with their feet</a> where they spend their time and energy. Like Linux, Apache, the www, and the w3c have demonstrated, &#8216;less friction&#8217; is still the best model for getting your technology in the hands of developers.</p>

<p>There are many protocols emerging to support the IoT including <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/">paho</a>, <a href="http://iot.eclipse.org/protocols.html#oma-lwm2m">OMA Lightweight M2M</a>, <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/moquette-mqtt">Moquette MQTT</a>, and <a href="http://www.onem2m.org/">oneM2M</a>. Open frameworks are under development as well, including: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/technology.kura/">Kura</a>, a Java &amp; OSGi based framework, and <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.ponte">Ponte</a>, billed as a bridge from M2M to REST.</p>

<p>Open hardware like the Arduino, Pi, and company will be equally as important as the software stack for ensuring the industry remains accessible to hobbyists and tinkerers alike. After his session Mike could be found giving demos of some IoT projects he&#8217;s currently working on. I&#8217;m sold; my first Raspberry Pi kit will be arriving next week.</p>

<h3>Smart Buildings - The Future of Construction Industry</h3>

<p>Dr. Pouria Ghods, speaking on behalf of <a href="http://www.giatecscientific.com/">Giatec Scientific</a>, defined &#8216;infrastructure&#8217; as the physical structures needed to support our society. As people responsible for  infrastructure, we need to be able to sense changes, react to them, and optimize the way we perform maintenance - all while keeping things safe for public use. Traditionally this sensing has been done in two important stages: during construction, and on a schedule for the rest of the structure&#8217;s lifespan.</p>

<p>There was much that I did not know about concrete. For example, each truckload of concrete is tested three times during the pour to ensure consistency. As I understand it, this test involves putting a small cylinder of the dried concrete under a large amount of load to ensure that it meets requirements of the structure. If it were to fail, the poured section of that structure would need to be redone. Dr. Ghods proposes that we can do better than this: by monitoring the concrete both inside the truck and again once it has been poured into its forms, we can increase our confidence in real-time that the mix is correct and consistent.</p>

<p>The state of the art for monitoring existing infrastructure still involves sending engineers on-site to probe and drag chains across concrete in search of faults and deterioration. Imagine instead a building that, after an earthquake, is able to report that it sensed an unusual amount of vibration on the 6th floor. Think of the time and money (and potentially, lives) that could be saved if a bridge could tell it&#8217;s engineers exactly where cracking or corrosion was starting to occur, before it became a threat to public safety.</p>

    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/05/30/mobile-apps-made-and-managed-in-aem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m thrilled to be returning to Basel this summer to present at the conference formerly known as CQCON: <a href="http://www.connectcon.ch/2014/en.html">CONNECT Web Experience</a>. This year I&#8217;ll be speaking about building and managing mobile applications within AEM, with a focus on the technical details of the solution.</p>

<p>To frame the context of the integration between AEM and PhoneGap, I told a story of a hypothetical company looking to extend the reach of their content by <a href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/03/14/so-you-want-to-build-an-app/">building a mobile app</a>. Since presenting at both <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-summit-2014/technical-session-mobile-app-development-and-content-management-with-aem/">Adobe SUMMIT</a> and <a href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/04/10/aemhub-mobile-apps-in-aem/">AEMHub</a>, I&#8217;ve had a chance to work with some real, non-hypothetical customers, and have selected a few themes from these experiences to highlight for an audience of highly-technical AEM pros.</p>

<p>Build it yourself, or leverage an existing library? Lean on jQuery/Zepto/xui, or forge on alone? AngularJS, Ember or Backbone? Bacon, ham or sausage? Today&#8217;s web developer has options aplenty when it comes to building product - too many even, you might argue. As developers of mobile apps we must choose carefully to ensure we&#8217;re simplifying our code base while not restricting our options as the platform evolves. We need to be conscious that all the processing power and memory available to our app will fit into our user&#8217;s pocket (&#8216;Note&#8217; users excluded). We must recognize that expectations of a mobile app are very different from that of the web, especially with regard to offline availability of content. As such, the decision of which 3rd party libraries to depend and build upon must be deeper than simply picking the flavour of the week. I&#8217;ll dig into the libraries we&#8217;ve had success working with and describe the long (and somewhat bumpy) road that led us to them.</p>

<p>Whether dealing with products in a commerce scenario or physical properties in hospitality, app content often involves a set of items that should be rendered in a similar fashion. This type of data lends itself nicely to a template based approach, one that is well supported by AngularJS. I&#8217;ll present one approach to structuring your data for consumption by AngularJS that results in a scalable - and maintainable - AEM app.</p>

<p>PhoneGap&#8217;s Javascript to native bridge is a key piece of the framework, one that serves to distinguish your app from a traditional mobile website by exposing access to platform APIs through it&#8217;s pluggable architecture. Some of the functionality supported by featured Cordova plugins include capturing images via the device camera(s), access to the contact database, file system access, and <a href="http://plugins.cordova.io/#/">many more</a>. I&#8217;ll present the patterns we followed to expose this bridge to our app&#8217;s components, and share code samples that&#8217;ll have you up and running with your own project in no time.</p>

<p>See you there.</p>

    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/03/14/so-you-want-to-build-an-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve been approached by management and given orders to begin architecting a plan to get that ever-coveted place in the app store. Your peers at the office are devoted iOS fans - aside from that one guy, still touting the battery life of his flip phone - and expect to see your work in their preferred store, and soon. However, upon reviewing mobile browser analytics from your company&#8217;s site, you notice a trend: not all traffic is from mobile Safari. Hits seem to be originating from Android browsers at about half the rate of Safari, and Google&#8217;s Chrome browser is not far behind. Your office may be satisfied with an iPhone app, but how will your Android customers take it?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Being a primarily web-oriented shop your developers are well versed in the finer points of building a progressively enhanced, responsive site that renders fast and legibly on devices of varying form factors, taking advantage of features present on the latest models while not leaving anyone behind (right?). They don&#8217;t have Objective-C experience, and their server side Java skills will only get them so far in Android or BlackBerry native development. There&#8217;s always the option of outsourcing, but it comes with a price tag - one that does not soon disappear if you plan on keeping your app healthy and relevant on the latest hardware.</p>

<p>Enter PhoneGap. A <a href="http://phonegap.com/2012/03/19/phonegap-cordova-and-what%E2%80%99s-in-a-name/">distribution of Apache Cordova</a>, PhoneGap is a project which describes itself as enabling cross-platform app development with web technologies you know and love. It sounds promising! You read on. Turns out PhoneGap is basically a web browser, augmented with a JavaScript bridge that provides direct access to device features including the file system, camera, accelerometer, geolocation, compass, contacts, <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.4.0/cordova_plugins_pluginapis.md.html#Plugin%20APIs">and more</a>. The plugin architecture is extensible, meaning any device feature that is not currently available can be implemented and added to your app, and even shared with the world if you feel so inclined. It has been around for about 5 years and <a href="http://phonegap.com/app/feature/">many successful apps</a> have been produced with it.</p>

<p>As it stands, PhoneGap supports all the device operating systems &amp; versions that your team plans to target. Now, if only there was a way to repurpose your brand&#8217;s most valuable asset: its content. Using Adobe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/solutions/web-experience-management.html">Experience Manager</a> (formerly CQ), your team has worked tirelessly to ensure the workflows and business logic are in place to support a distributed team of content authors, marketing personnel, and IT users alike. Your authors have built a solid foundation in the solution, and have embraced the agility afforded by being able to contribute on their various devices via the touch-friendly user interface. If only there was a way&#8230;</p>

<p>Well, there is. This spring I&#8217;m thrilled to be sharing the details of the AEM 6.0 and PhoneGap integration at both <a href="https://adobesummit.activeevents.com/2014/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1211">Adobe SUMMIT</a> in Salt Lake City, and <a href="http://aemhub.cognifide.com/speakers.html#Bruce-Lefebvre">AEM Hub</a> - a brand new conference taking place in London. I hope you will join me.</p>

    <link href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2013/08/22/setting-up-a-dispatcher-on-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-22T22:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2013/08/22/setting-up-a-dispatcher-on-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The dispatcher is an important piece of a secure, stable, and solidly-performing AEM implementation. According to <a href="http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/dispatcher.html">the documentation</a> it can provide caching, load balancing, as well as help to protect your publish instances from attack. For such a multifaceted tool it seems to receive very little attention during the dev process, typically called to action in the final stages of a deployment when most of the dev work has already been done. I propose that developers (including myself) could write better code if they had a deeper understanding of this tool, which is why I went through the process of setting one up on my Mac. What follows are my notes.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll need to get started:</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>OS X machine with Apache installed and enabled</li>
<li>AEM 5.6.1 quickstart

<ul>
<li>author on :4502</li>
<li>publish on :4503</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Figure out which version of Apache httpd you&#8217;re working with:</p>

<pre><code>$ httpd -v
</code></pre>

<p>Download and extract the correct dispatcher version for your httpd:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/companies/public/adobe/dispatcher/dispatcher.html">https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/companies/public/adobe/dispatcher/dispatcher.html</a></p>

<p>Inside the extracted directory you will find a file named &#8216;dispatcher-apache&lt;version&gt;.so&#8217;. Copy this file to /usr/libexec/apache2. In my case:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo cp dispatcher-apache2.2-4.1.4.so /usr/libexec/apache2
</code></pre>

<p>Head to the apache2 modules directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /usr/libexec/apache2/
</code></pre>

<p> Create a symlink to the dispatcher module you just copied over:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ln -s dispatcher-apache2.2-4.1.4.so mod_dispatcher.so
</code></pre>

<p>Head to /etc/apache2 to configure it:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /etc/apache2
</code></pre>

<p>Open httpd.conf (as root) with your editor of choice and add the following line to the end of the LoadModule section (line 119 in my case):</p>

<pre><code>LoadModule dispatcher_module libexec/apache2/mod_dispatcher.so
</code></pre>

<p>After this line, add the following configuration:</p>

<pre><code># configure the minimal setting for the dispatcher
# the main configuration is read from the 'DispatcherConfig' file.
&lt;IfModule disp_apache2.c&gt;
    # location of the configuration file. eg: 'conf/dispatcher.any'
    DispatcherConfig /etc/apache2/conf/dispatcher.any

    # location of the dispatcher log file. eg: 'logs/dispatcher.log'
    DispatcherLog    /var/log/apache2/dispatcher.log

    # log level for the dispatcher log
    # 0 Errors
    # 1 Warnings
    # 2 Infos
    # 3 Debug
    DispatcherLogLevel 3

    # if turned to 1, the dispatcher looks like a normal module
    # since build 5210, this setting has no effect, since it used to crash
    # apache if set to 0.
    DispatcherNoServerHeader 1

    # if turned to 1, request to / are not handled by the dispatcher
    # use the mod_alias then for the correct mapping
    DispatcherDeclineRoot 0
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

&lt;Directory /&gt;
    &lt;IfModule disp_apache2.c&gt;
        # enable dispatcher for ALL request. if this is too restrictive,
        # move it to another location
        SetHandler dispatcher-handler
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;

    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Create a directory named &#8216;conf&#8217; in /etc/apache2</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/conf
</code></pre>

<p>From the extracted dispatcher directory, copy the provided dispatcher.any to conf:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/Downloads/dispatcher-apache2.2-darwin-x86-64-4.1.4/conf/
$ sudo cp dispatcher.any /etc/apache2/conf/
</code></pre>

<p>Open the copy of dispatcher.any with your editor of choice. Look for the &#8216;/renders&#8217; entry, and point the &#8216;/rend01&#8217; instance host name and port to your publish instance:</p>

<pre><code>/hostname "127.0.0.1"
/port "4503"
</code></pre>

<p>Allow requests with authorized header (uncomment and change value) in dispatcher.any:</p>

<pre><code>/allowAuthorized "1"
</code></pre>

<p>Set the document root directory (search for the existing value):</p>

<pre><code>/docroot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
</code></pre>

<p>Check your config syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apachectl configtest
</code></pre>

<p>The previous command should have outputted &#8216;Syntax OK&#8217;.</p>

<p>Did it not? You may need to correct your configuration. &#8216;apachectl configtest&#8217; should be able to tell you on which line your config is broken.</p>

<p>Give your httpd document root directory to the _www user and group:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo chown _www:_www /Library/WebServer/Documents/
</code></pre>

<p>Stop Apache httpd:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apachectl stop
</code></pre>

<p>In another terminal window (or tab), tail the following log files for errors:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f /var/log/apache2/error_log /var/log/apache2/dispatcher.log
</code></pre>

<p>Start Apache httpd back up:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apachectl start
</code></pre>

<p>Barring any errors in the logs you should now be able to browse your AEM publish content via the dispatcher:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/content/geometrixx-media/en.html">http://localhost/content/geometrixx-media/en.html</a></p>

<p>You can also poke around /Library/WebServer/Documents/ to see how the static content is stored on the file system.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;ve just configured your very own dispatcher. I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface here and really glazed over much of the configuration, so make sure to read the following resources before releasing this dispatcher into the wild:</p>
