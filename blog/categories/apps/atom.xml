    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/release-notes.html">AEM 6.1 out the door</a>, we've pushed some commits to the <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit">Starter Kit repository</a> to ensure that the apps you bootstrap with it are taking advantage of the present state of the art. What follows is a visual tour of a few of those improvements.</p>

<h3>Native Page Transitions</h3>

<p><img src="/images/starter-kit-improvements/transitions.gif" title="'App showcasing native transitions'" ></p>

<p>Transitions between pages play such a big role in how your app's performance is perceived, yet perfecting this animation with CSS can stump even the sharpest front-end dev. The Starter Kit now comes with the excellent <a href="https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/NativePageTransitions">Native Page Transitions</a> plugin enabled by default, delivering buttery smooth transitions while offloading the tedious <code>translate3d</code> (or was it <code>transform</code>?) work to native hardware acceleration. Many thanks go to <a href="https://twitter.com/eddyverbruggen">@eddyverbruggen</a> for all the hard work that went into this plugin!</p>

<h3>PhoneGap/Cordova CLI 5</h3>

<p><img src="/images/starter-kit-improvements/phonegap_cli_5.gif" title="'PhoneGap CLI v5 in action'" ></p>

<p>The latest PhoneGap command line interface (CLI) release contains a <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/04/28/phonegap-cli-5.0.0-0.27.0/">bunch of improvements</a>, but is (unfortunately) not compatible with the Geometrixx sample that shipped with 6.1. Not to fear: we will be releasing a rev of the sample shortly. In the meantime our Starter Kit is all set to take advantage of the new CLI, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cordova Android v4, which introduces support for <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a>!</li>
<li>The use of config.xml to manage platforms and plugins - a tidy alternative to writing custom hooks</li>
<li>Latest versions of all core plugins, including PhoneGap's brand new <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-contentsync">Content Sync plugin</a></li>
<li>Analytics instrumentation with Adobe's Mobile Services plugin</li>
</ul>


<h3>Separation of code from authorable content</h3>

<p><img src="/images/starter-kit-improvements/separation.png" title="'content-dev and content-author have split'" ></p>

<p>The code you write and the content your authors manage has been separated into two content packages to facilitate management as your AEM Apps project grows. With this model, you can continue to iterate on the code while authors work on the content without stepping on one another's changes.</p>

<h3>... And more!</h3>

<p><img src="/images/starter-kit-improvements/responsive_sim.gif" title="'Responsive simulator in action'" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Responsive Simulator in the touch optimized editor is enabled by default</li>
<li>Starter Kit no longer includes a dependency on Geometrixx app code</li>
<li>Cordova splash page now sticks around until app initialization is complete</li>
</ul>


<p>We hope you find the new and improved <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit">Starter Kit</a> helpful for bootstrapping your next AEM Apps project! Please feel free to reach out in the comments below if you have any issues making it work for you, or have any other questions on AEM Apps.</p>

    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2015/02/05/summit-2015-mobile-app-dev-and-content-management-with-aem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm thrilled to be returning to beautiful Salt Lake City this March to host a technical session on <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2015/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2586">Mobile App Development and Content Management with AEM</a> at Adobe SUMMIT 2015.</p>

<p>Digging through my chicken scratch in an old notebook, I was able to locate what I suspect to be my notes from one of the first meetings about the potential of an integration between Adobe PhoneGap (then, version 1.9) and AEM - better known as CQ 5.5 at the time (circa July 2012):</p>

<p><img src="/images/phonegap_cq_notes.jpeg" title="'First thoughts on Adobe PhoneGap and AEM'" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Reflecting from nearly three years later reveals that while much has changed, many of our initial thoughts on the subject still hold true today. As the number of platforms in the mobile space keeps growing it's never been more important to be able to "write apps that behave as native apps without having to learn a new language". With all the improvements that have been made to the web since we began, there is still a "gap" in the device features available to sites we visit with our mobile browsers and the APIs available to apps installed on our home screens. Still, the proposition of building apps with web technology we know and love is as appealing as I thought it was in 2012.</p>

<p>The integration of AEM and Adobe PhoneGap has come a long way in this time. Building on the feedback I received from my session at last year's SUMMIT, my talk - <a href="https://adobesummit.lanyonevents.com/2015/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2586">Mobile app dev and content management with AEM</a> - will take a technical deep dive into PhoneGap Enterprise. We'll be covering as much as I can possibly fit into an hour: from creating your very first PhoneGap Enterprise app, to managing that app with the new and improved AEM Apps dashboard, to testing (from unit to integration to acceptance), and closing with a look at publishing content updates to your app - ensuring your customers will keep coming back for more. We'll accomplish all this without losing track of our goals: utilizing tools that your team already knows, simplifying your overall app management pain points, and putting your brand in pole position with a flexible platform to deliver the next generation of mobile experiences.</p>

<p>After all this time, I still find it exciting.</p>

    <link href="http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/11/17/aem-apps-featurepack-updates/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-17T11:16:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2014/11/17/aem-apps-featurepack-updates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A keen observer of AEM's Package Share may have noticed two new offerings show up in the past couple of weeks. In particular, our team is thrilled to announce the availability of the <a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq600/featurepack/cq-6.0.0-featurepack-4558">AEM Apps feature pack 1</a>, and an updated <a href="https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq60/product/cq-geometrixx-outdoors-app-pkg">Geometrixx Outdoors App sample</a> which demonstrates the usage of these new features. Let's take a quick tour.</p>

<h3>Application Command Center</h3>

<p>The feature pack includes a single user interface for managing all aspects of an app’s lifecycle. The Command Center enables you to keep app content fresh and relevant, while understanding how the app is performing in one intuitive view.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sample-updates/apps-command-center.png" title="'AEM Apps Command Center'" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Towards the top left of this screenshot is the Details pane which enables configuration of app metadata including name and description, screenshots for app store submission, and update server URL amongst others. Heading clockwise is the Metrics pane which provides a high-level overview of key analytics data and gives access to Adobe Mobile Services for those wishing to delve further into the details. Last but not least is the PhoneGap Build tile which seamlessly integrates with Adobe's cloud build service, enabling users to compile apps across three platforms without installing an SDK or configuring a single environment variable (you're welcome, Windows users).</p>

<h3>App Update Management</h3>

<p>Application content can be updated instantly without requiring a trip back to the platform's app store. Updates are managed through a straightforward workflow and tools are provided to verify content changes in development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sample-updates/content-sync-update.jpg" title="'Content Sync Update Management'" ></p>

<p>In this screenshot I'm naming my latest update - a straightforward change of business hours - to keep a log of each update that I push out to my customers.</p>

<h3>App Content Authoring</h3>

<p>Content authors (non-technical users) can easily create and update app content using a touch based, WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop interface. The feature pack includes new mobile-optimized components for easy content creation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sample-updates/apps-authoring.png" title="'Touch friendly authoring in action'" ></p>

<p>Pictured here is an app I created for my talk at <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2014/">PhoneGap Day</a> which I updated over-the-air on stage to demonstrate some of the capabilities of AEM Apps. The source for my demo can be <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-pgday-talk-app">found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Digital Publishing Suite Adobe Content Viewer Access</h3>

<p>The latest release of the Adobe Content Viewer can connect directly to an AEM authoring environment. Now AEM generated DPS content can be tested and validated without having to upload to the DPS Folio Publisher Service, enabling you to iterate more quickly on your content.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sample-updates/dps-acv.png" width="320" title="'Adobe Content Viewer'" ></p>

<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>

<p>To complement the feature pack release, we've updated our <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-phonegap-starter-kit">AEM Apps Starter Kit</a> to take advantage of the state of the art in enterprise application development with AEM. Take a look at the README to see just how easy it is to bootstrap your own AEM Apps project today.</p>

<p>I've also brought my <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink">AEM Apps Kitchen Sink</a> project up to spec. If you haven't tried it yet, the Kitchen Sink is an AEM App which demonstrates the usage of various Cordova/PhoneGap API's, implemented as authorable components in an application that can be updated over-the-air.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sample-updates/kitchen-sink-update.png" width="320" title="'Kitchen Sink OTA update'" ></p>

<p>On the technical side, the Kitchen Sink's AEM page component has been completely re-written using <a href="http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/sightly.html">Sightly</a>, and we don't think you'll miss JSP <em>at all</em>. Performance junkies will be pleased to learn that every page transition in the Kitchen Sink is handled by the awesome <a href="http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/native-page-transitions">NativePageTransitions</a> plugin.</p>

<p>As always, feedback or questions on the above are welcome. Please feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/brucelefebvre">twitter</a> or via the comments on this post.</p>
