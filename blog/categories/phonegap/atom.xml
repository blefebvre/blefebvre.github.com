<p>As I compose this post at a kitchen table 850 km from home I can't help but think about how much these shiny pocket computers have changed the way we work, play, and live. According to Apple's numbers there have been over 75 billion individual app downloads since the introduction of the platform. At roughly this point last year Android was poised to overtake that number, reporting a staggering 2.5 billion downloads per month. As web technologists, how can we leverage our skill set to get in on the action?</p>

<p>In my talk at adaptTo() I'll delve into Apache Cordova, a project built to enable cross-platform app development with standards-based web technology. I'll explore how it can be used to interface directly with Apache Sling, and close with a demo of how the AEM + Cordova integration (affectionately known as PhoneGap Enterprise) can be used to empower your marketing personnel to keep your application's content relevant with tools they already love. Code samples will be included to get you started today - with or without an AEM license.</p>

<p>If you have any questions that you'd like to see addressed during the talk, please feel free to reach out in the comments section below. Hope to see you there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm thrilled to be returning to Basel this summer to present at the conference formerly known as CQCON: <a href="http://www.connectcon.ch/2014/en.html">CONNECT Web Experience</a>. This year I'll be speaking about building and managing mobile applications within AEM, with a focus on the technical details of the solution.</p>

<p>To frame the context of the integration between AEM and PhoneGap, I told a story of a hypothetical company looking to extend the reach of their content by <a href="/blog/2014/03/14/so-you-want-to-build-an-app/">building a mobile app</a>. Since presenting at both <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-summit-2014/technical-session-mobile-app-development-and-content-management-with-aem/">Adobe SUMMIT</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/04/10/aemhub-mobile-apps-in-aem/">AEMHub</a>, I've had a chance to work with some real, non-hypothetical customers, and have selected a few themes from these experiences to highlight for an audience of highly-technical AEM pros.</p>

<p>Build it yourself, or leverage an existing library? Lean on jQuery/Zepto/xui, or forge on alone? AngularJS, Ember or Backbone? Bacon, ham or sausage? Today's web developer has options aplenty when it comes to building product - too many even, you might argue. As developers of mobile apps we must choose carefully to ensure we're simplifying our code base while not restricting our options as the platform evolves. We need to be conscious that all the processing power and memory available to our app will fit into our user's pocket ('Note' users excluded). We must recognize that expectations of a mobile app are very different from that of the web, especially with regard to offline availability of content. As such, the decision of which 3rd party libraries to depend and build upon must be deeper than simply picking the flavour of the week. I'll dig into the libraries we've had success working with and describe the long (and somewhat bumpy) road that led us to them.</p>

<p>Whether dealing with products in a commerce scenario or physical properties in hospitality, app content often involves a set of items that should be rendered in a similar fashion. This type of data lends itself nicely to a template based approach, one that is well supported by AngularJS. I'll present one approach to structuring your data for consumption by AngularJS that results in a scalable - and maintainable - AEM app.</p>

<p>PhoneGap's Javascript to native bridge is a key piece of the framework, one that serves to distinguish your app from a traditional mobile website by exposing access to platform APIs through it's pluggable architecture. Some of the functionality supported by featured Cordova plugins include capturing images via the device camera(s), access to the contact database, file system access, and <a href="http://plugins.cordova.io/#/">many more</a>. I'll present the patterns we followed to expose this bridge to our app's components, and share code samples that'll have you up and running with your own project in no time.</p>

<p>See you there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You've been approached by management and given orders to begin architecting a plan to get that ever-coveted place in the app store. Your peers at the office are devoted iOS fans - aside from that one guy, still touting the battery life of his flip phone - and expect to see your work in their preferred store, and soon. However, upon reviewing mobile browser analytics from your company's site, you notice a trend: not all traffic is from mobile Safari. Hits seem to be originating from Android browsers at about half the rate of Safari, and Google's Chrome browser is not far behind. Your office may be satisfied with an iPhone app, but how will your Android customers take it?</p>

<p>Being a primarily web-oriented shop your developers are well versed in the finer points of building a progressively enhanced, responsive site that renders fast and legibly on devices of varying form factors, taking advantage of features present on the latest models while not leaving anyone behind (right?). They don't have Objective-C experience, and their server side Java skills will only get them so far in Android or BlackBerry native development. There's always the option of outsourcing, but it comes with a price tag - one that does not soon disappear if you plan on keeping your app healthy and relevant on the latest hardware.</p>

<p>Enter PhoneGap. A <a href="http://phonegap.com/2012/03/19/phonegap-cordova-and-what%E2%80%99s-in-a-name/">distribution of Apache Cordova</a>, PhoneGap is a project which describes itself as enabling cross-platform app development with web technologies you know and love. It sounds promising! You read on. Turns out PhoneGap is basically a web browser, augmented with a JavaScript bridge that provides direct access to device features including the file system, camera, accelerometer, geolocation, compass, contacts, <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.4.0/cordova_plugins_pluginapis.md.html#Plugin%20APIs">and more</a>. The plugin architecture is extensible, meaning any device feature that is not currently available can be implemented and added to your app, and even shared with the world if you feel so inclined. It has been around for about 5 years and <a href="http://phonegap.com/app/feature/">many successful apps</a> have been produced with it.</p>

<p>As it stands, PhoneGap supports all the device operating systems &amp; versions that your team plans to target. Now, if only there was a way to repurpose your brand's most valuable asset: its content. Using Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/solutions/web-experience-management.html">Experience Manager</a> (formerly CQ), your team has worked tirelessly to ensure the workflows and business logic are in place to support a distributed team of content authors, marketing personnel, and IT users alike. Your authors have built a solid foundation in the solution, and have embraced the agility afforded by being able to contribute on their various devices via the touch-friendly user interface. If only there was a way...</p>

<p>Well, there is. This spring I'm thrilled to be sharing the details of the AEM 6.0 and PhoneGap integration at both <a href="https://adobesummit.activeevents.com/2014/slc/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1211">Adobe SUMMIT</a> in Salt Lake City, and <a href="http://aemhub.cognifide.com/speakers.html#Bruce-Lefebvre">AEM Hub</a> - a brand new conference taking place in London. I hope you will join me.</p>
