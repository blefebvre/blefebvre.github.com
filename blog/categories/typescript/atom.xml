    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article gives an introduction to my preferred development setup of 2018 for building mobile applications: React Native with TypeScript and CocoaPods, coded in the awesome Visual Studio Code editor.</p>

<p>Over the past 8 months I've had the pleasure of working on a side project with a very special customer: my Dad. His idea was to create an iOS app to give users a consolidated view of the investments they hold across multiple accounts. I suggested that such a thing must surely already exist -- which it did, but none of the existing offerings suited him, primarily due to his comfort level in trusting the app developer to store and manage his investment data in a secure manner. With the seemingly constant stream of news covering large corporations being hacked, I couldn't blame him for this concern.</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/5-spec.jpg" title="The original spec." ></p>

<p>With the delivery of the app's spec accompanied by a hand-written cover letter, the project was on.</p>

<!-- 
The solution we came up with was one where the data would be stored locally on-device, which we found to have a number of benefits:

- There would be no server for us to manage, patch, keep online, and serve as a single point of failure for the app
- There would be no server-side code to develop, debug, load test, and monitor
- The app would work offline out-of-the-box, since this would be the primary use case
- If our users' wished to sync their data with another device, the app could be integrated with a service like Dropbox (a pattern we'd seen work well in other apps, such as [1Password](https://1password.com/))
-->




<!--
We were sold on the approach, and I began looking into options for storing relational data device-side with minimal overhead. SQLite quickly became the natural choice: it's fast, rock solid, and has been battle tested for years across a huge array of platforms and devices. 
-->


<p>In an effort to use this side project as a learning opportunity, I picked a technology that I'd been interested in for ages but had yet to find a use case for: React Native. As a huge React fan for building web UIs I was instantly hooked. There were a few gotchas along the way but my experience was almost entirely positive. I intend to cover a few interesting aspects of building this app over the next few blog posts -- including SQLite, Dropbox integration, syncing data between devices, and testing -- but this one will focus on simply bootstrapping the React Native project that I'll build upon in future posts.</p>

<h2>Tools of the trade</h2>

<p>To follow along with this article you will need a Mac, and the tools indicated in the "Installing dependencies" section of the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies">Getting Started page of the React Native docs</a>. Please work through this section of the linked doc before moving on!</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>I had initially written a medium-length novel on setting up TypeScript to work in a React Native app (RN going forward), but discovered an extremely helpful little project that offers a template to quickly bootstrap an RN app with built-in TypeScript support. Big thanks to GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/emin93">emin93</a> for building and supporting the very handy <a href="https://github.com/emin93/react-native-template-typescript">react-native-template-typescript</a> repo! I sure wish that I'd known about this when I initially bootstrapped my app.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, I was using Node <code>v8.12.0</code> and react-native <code>2.0.1</code>. Let's begin:</p>

<pre><code>react-native init MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp --template typescript
cd MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp/
node setup.js
</code></pre>

<p>To run the TypeScript compiler, and watch the filesystem for changes, run:</p>

<pre><code>npm run tsc -- -w
</code></pre>

<p>Annnnd we're done! With TypeScript support, anyways. You should now have a terminal window open that is displaying something to the effect of:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/2-tsc.png" title="TypeScript CLI watching the source. No errors detected." ></p>

<p>At this point I'd recommend opening up the directory you've initialized your app into with the <a href="">Visual Studio Code</a> editor. It is free, has excellent support for TypeScript (both are built by Microsoft), and a big community behind it. You may need to install the <code>code</code> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">command in your path</a> before running this:</p>

<pre><code>code .
</code></pre>

<p>Not much there, right? I mean, outside of the node_modules directory, of course ðŸ˜…. Keep the VS Code window open, and we'll come back to it in a moment.</p>

<h2>CocoaPods</h2>

<p>I wanted to make this as real-world an example as possible, so we're going to be setting up CocoaPods as well. CocoaPods is supported by a number of 3rd party RN libraries to quickly and easily wire up the parts of each library that involve native code. We'll use it extensively over the next few blog posts on RN. <a href="https://shift.infinite.red/beginner-s-guide-to-using-cocoapods-with-react-native-46cb4d372995">This article on shift.infinite.red</a> goes way deeper in depth on CocoaPods setup, but I am going to skip right to the commands I used to initialize my project.</p>

<p>If you do not yet have CocoaPods installed:</p>

<pre><code>gem install cocoapods
</code></pre>

<p>Init CocoaPods in the ios/ directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd ios/
pod init
</code></pre>

<p>Locate your Podfile in VS Code, or open it from the CLI:</p>

<pre><code>code Podfile
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the contents of your Podfile with the following (assumes you've named your app <code>MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp</code>; simply replace that string if that's not the case):</p>

<p>```
target 'MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp' do
  # Pods for MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp</p>

<p>  pod 'yoga', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga'</p>

<p>  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [</p>

<pre><code>'DevSupport',
'RCTLinkingIOS',
'RCTImage'
</code></pre>

<p>  ]</p>

<p>  # We'll add the react-native-sqlite-storage package during a later post here</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|</p>

<pre><code># The following is needed to ensure the "archive" step works in XCode.
# It removes React &amp; Yoga from the Pods project, as it is already included in the main project.
# Without this, you'd see errors when you archive like:
# "Multiple commands produce ... libReact.a"
# "Multiple commands produce ... libyoga.a"

targets_to_ignore = %w(React yoga)

if targets_to_ignore.include? target.name
  target.remove_from_project
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Tell CocoaPods to process your Podfile and install the Pods you've included above (still in the <code>ios/</code> dir):</p>

<pre><code>pod install
</code></pre>

<p>If successful, you should see a message printed to the console that indicates something to the effect of (check above the <code>PBXBuildFile --</code> output):</p>

<blockquote><p>Pod installation complete! There are 4 dependencies from the Podfile and 2 total pods installed.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you see a failure at this point, I would recommend digging in to the <a href="https://shift.infinite.red/beginner-s-guide-to-using-cocoapods-with-react-native-46cb4d372995">shift.infinite.red article</a> and resolving the issue before moving on.</p>

<!-- 

At the time of writing, [facebook/react-native/issues/21310](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21310) was open which meant that I had to add `@babel/runtime` via npm to enable the RN Metro bundler to correctly create an app bundle:

    npm install --save-dev @babel/runtime

-->


<p>OK! This is a good point to check that the app we just created is in fact runnable. To avoid over-complicating this tutorial I am going to focus on iOS only, but each dependency I have included is supported on Android as well. Per the <code>pod install</code> console output, make sure to use the <code>MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp.xcworkspace</code> file to open your iOS project from now on in Xcode. Still in the <code>ios/</code> directory, run:</p>

<pre><code>open MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp.xcworkspace
</code></pre>

<p>In Xcode, select a simulator to target and tap the Play button to build and run your app. With any luck, you should see the Metro Bundler open in a Terminal window, and the iOS simulator should show your app running alongside it. This could take a few minutes during the first run of the app since there's lots of native code to be compiled:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/1-app-running.png" title="'App running on the iOS simulator'" ></p>

<p>Did you have an issue starting up the app? Try clearing the Metro cache, and running the app again from Xcode:</p>

<pre><code>react-native start --reset-cache
</code></pre>

<h2>Make a code change</h2>

<p>You've made it this far. Finally, let's make a change to the code to see it reflected <em>immediately</em> in the iOS simulator. To enable this super-slick workflow, we will need to enable Hot Reloading. In the iOS simulator, tap Command+D to open the development menu.</p>

<p>Did that not do anything? Sometimes this happens to me as well. Try triggering a "shake gesture" via the Hardware menu:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/3-shake.png" title="'Triggering a shake gesture'" ></p>

<p>With the developer menu open, make sure Live Reload is <em>disabled</em> and Hot Reload is <em>enabled</em>. Your menu should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/4-dev-menu.png" title="'Triggering a shake gesture'" ></p>

<p>We're now ready to make a change to the code. Open App.tsx with VS Code, and make a change to some of the text in the JSX of the App component's <code>render()</code> function, such as changing "Welcome to React Native!" to "THIS IS AWESOME!". Save the file. Observe the iOS simulator...</p>

<p>Within seconds your code change should be reflected in the simulator. This is one of my favourite features that the React Native toolchain enables, and I find I can get seriously productive when I see my code changes reflected immediately like this.</p>

<p>I hope you've found this useful! Stay tuned for more articles on my experience working on this project with React Native, coming soon.</p>
