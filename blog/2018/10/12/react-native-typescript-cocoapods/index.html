<div class="entry-content"><p>This article gives an introduction to my preferred development setup of 2018 for building mobile applications: React Native with TypeScript and CocoaPods, coded in the awesome Visual Studio Code editor.</p>

<p>Over the past 8 months I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working on a side project with a very special customer: my Dad. His idea was to create an iOS app to give users a consolidated view of the investments they hold across multiple accounts. I suggested that such a thing must surely already exist &#8211; which it did, but none of the existing offerings suited him, primarily due to his comfort level in trusting the app developer to store and manage his investment data in a secure manner. With the seemingly constant stream of news covering large corporations being hacked, I couldn&#8217;t blame him for this concern.</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/5-spec.jpg" title="The original spec." ></p>

<p>With the delivery of the app&#8217;s spec accompanied by a hand-written cover letter, the project was on.</p>

<!-- more -->




<!-- 
The solution we came up with was one where the data would be stored locally on-device, which we found to have a number of benefits:

- There would be no server for us to manage, patch, keep online, and serve as a single point of failure for the app
- There would be no server-side code to develop, debug, load test, and monitor
- The app would work offline out-of-the-box, since this would be the primary use case
- If our users' wished to sync their data with another device, the app could be integrated with a service like Dropbox (a pattern we'd seen work well in other apps, such as [1Password](https://1password.com/))
-->




<!--
We were sold on the approach, and I began looking into options for storing relational data device-side with minimal overhead. SQLite quickly became the natural choice: it's fast, rock solid, and has been battle tested for years across a huge array of platforms and devices. 
-->


<p>In an effort to use this side project as a learning opportunity, I picked a technology that I&#8217;d been interested in for ages but had yet to find a use case for: React Native. As a huge React fan for building web UIs I was instantly hooked. There were a few gotchas along the way but my experience was almost entirely positive. I intend to cover a few interesting aspects of building this app over the next few blog posts &#8211; including SQLite, Dropbox integration, syncing data between devices, and testing &#8211; but this one will focus on simply bootstrapping the React Native project that I&#8217;ll build upon in future posts.</p>

<h2>Tools of the trade</h2>

<p>To follow along with this article you will need a Mac, and the tools indicated in the &#8220;Installing dependencies&#8221; section of the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies">Getting Started page of the React Native docs</a>. Please work through this section of the linked doc before moving on!</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>I had initially written a medium-length novel on setting up TypeScript to work in a React Native app (RN going forward), but discovered an extremely helpful little project that offers a template to quickly bootstrap an RN app with built-in TypeScript support. Big thanks to GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/emin93">emin93</a> for building and supporting the very handy <a href="https://github.com/emin93/react-native-template-typescript">react-native-template-typescript</a> repo! I sure wish that I&#8217;d known about this when I initially bootstrapped my app.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, I was using Node <code>v8.12.0</code> and react-native <code>2.0.1</code>. Let&#8217;s begin:</p>

<pre><code>react-native init MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp --template typescript
cd MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp/
node setup.js
</code></pre>

<p>To run the TypeScript compiler, and watch the filesystem for changes, run:</p>

<pre><code>npm run tsc -- -w
</code></pre>

<p>Annnnd we&#8217;re done! With TypeScript support, anyways. You should now have a terminal window open that is displaying something to the effect of:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/2-tsc.png" title="TypeScript CLI watching the source. No errors detected." ></p>

<p>At this point I&#8217;d recommend opening up the directory you&#8217;ve initialized your app into with the <a href="">Visual Studio Code</a> editor. It is free, has excellent support for TypeScript (both are built by Microsoft), and a big community behind it. You may need to install the <code>code</code> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">command in your path</a> before running this:</p>

<pre><code>code .
</code></pre>

<p>Not much there, right? I mean, outside of the node_modules directory, of course ðŸ˜…. Keep the VS Code window open, and we&#8217;ll come back to it in a moment.</p>

<h2>CocoaPods</h2>

<p>I wanted to make this as real-world an example as possible, so we&#8217;re going to be setting up CocoaPods as well. CocoaPods is supported by a number of 3rd party RN libraries to quickly and easily wire up the parts of each library that involve native code. We&#8217;ll use it extensively over the next few blog posts on RN. <a href="https://shift.infinite.red/beginner-s-guide-to-using-cocoapods-with-react-native-46cb4d372995">This article on shift.infinite.red</a> goes way deeper in depth on CocoaPods setup, but I am going to skip right to the commands I used to initialize my project.</p>

<p>If you do not yet have CocoaPods installed:</p>

<pre><code>gem install cocoapods
</code></pre>

<p>Init CocoaPods in the ios/ directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd ios/
pod init
</code></pre>

<p>Locate your Podfile in VS Code, or open it from the CLI:</p>

<pre><code>code Podfile
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the contents of your Podfile with the following (assumes you&#8217;ve named your app <code>MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp</code>; simply replace that string if that&#8217;s not the case):</p>

</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Tell CocoaPods to process your Podfile and install the Pods you&#8217;ve included above (still in the <code>ios/</code> dir):</p>

<pre><code>pod install
</code></pre>

<p>If successful, you should see a message printed to the console that indicates something to the effect of (check above the <code>PBXBuildFile --</code> output):</p>

<blockquote><p>Pod installation complete! There are 4 dependencies from the Podfile and 2 total pods installed.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you see a failure at this point, I would recommend digging in to the <a href="https://shift.infinite.red/beginner-s-guide-to-using-cocoapods-with-react-native-46cb4d372995">shift.infinite.red article</a> and resolving the issue before moving on.</p>

<!-- 

At the time of writing, [facebook/react-native/issues/21310](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21310) was open which meant that I had to add `@babel/runtime` via npm to enable the RN Metro bundler to correctly create an app bundle:

    npm install --save-dev @babel/runtime

-->


<p>OK! This is a good point to check that the app we just created is in fact runnable. To avoid over-complicating this tutorial I am going to focus on iOS only, but each dependency I have included is supported on Android as well. Per the <code>pod install</code> console output, make sure to use the <code>MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp.xcworkspace</code> file to open your iOS project from now on in Xcode. Still in the <code>ios/</code> directory, run:</p>

<pre><code>open MyReactNativeTypeScriptApp.xcworkspace
</code></pre>

<p>In Xcode, select a simulator to target and tap the Play button to build and run your app. With any luck, you should see the Metro Bundler open in a Terminal window, and the iOS simulator should show your app running alongside it. This could take a few minutes during the first run of the app since there&#8217;s lots of native code to be compiled:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/1-app-running.png" title="'App running on the iOS simulator'" ></p>

<p>Did you have an issue starting up the app? Try clearing the Metro cache, and running the app again from Xcode:</p>

<pre><code>react-native start --reset-cache
</code></pre>

<h2>Make a code change</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ve made it this far. Finally, let&#8217;s make a change to the code to see it reflected <em>immediately</em> in the iOS simulator. To enable this super-slick workflow, we will need to enable Hot Reloading. In the iOS simulator, tap Command+D to open the development menu.</p>

<p>Did that not do anything? Sometimes this happens to me as well. Try triggering a &#8220;shake gesture&#8221; via the Hardware menu:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/3-shake.png" title="'Triggering a shake gesture'" ></p>

<p>With the developer menu open, make sure Live Reload is <em>disabled</em> and Hot Reload is <em>enabled</em>. Your menu should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/react-native/4-dev-menu.png" title="'Triggering a shake gesture'" ></p>

<p>We&#8217;re now ready to make a change to the code. Open App.tsx with VS Code, and make a change to some of the text in the JSX of the App component&#8217;s <code>render()</code> function, such as changing &#8220;Welcome to React Native!&#8221; to &#8220;THIS IS AWESOME!&#8221;. Save the file. Observe the iOS simulator&#8230;</p>

<p>Within seconds your code change should be reflected in the simulator. This is one of my favourite features that the React Native toolchain enables, and I find I can get seriously productive when I see my code changes reflected immediately like this.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;ve found this useful! Stay tuned for more articles on my experience working on this project with React Native, coming soon.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>I highly recommend working through the steps yourself to get all the latest dependencies, but you can find the result of running through these instructions here:</p>

<p>Lastly, the app I wrote about in the intro is now live! Send an email to <code>bruce at &lt;this domain&gt;</code> if you&#8217;d like to try it out.</p>
